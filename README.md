# Transfomers

In this repository I'll explore various transformer architectures, starting by the original transformer which I have already implement in the `attention-is-all-you-need.ipynb` notebook, and tested a simple training pipeline for this architecture in the `training.ipynb` notebook.

This repo is currently a work in progress.
